Approach:
We can see that we need to run a loop for a row number of times. We need to run a loop for 5 rows in the example here. This forms the external loop.
We need to run a loop to print n numbers in each row, where n is the row number. This forms the internal loop.
In the example above, we have 5 rows. For 5 rows, we need an external loop that goes from n = 1 to n = 5 (i.e. no of rows).
For each row, we need to print numbers from num = 1 to num = n.
Example : For the 5th row, n = 5. The internal loop goes from num = 1 to num = 5. The 5th row becomes: 1 2 3 4 5
